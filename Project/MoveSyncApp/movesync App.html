            <h2>Application Description</h2>
            <section class="project-details">
                <p>
                    To ensure safe and effective interaction with the robot, a dedicated Android application was
                    developed using MIT App Inventor.
                    The application serves as the main interface between the user and the robot, providing both control
                    and real-time monitoring in a simple and user-friendly manner
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the application, the user can remotely control the robot’s movement smoothly in all
                    directions via Bluetooth communication. This allows the robot to navigate hazardous or hard-to-reach
                    areas without exposing humans to danger
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to control, the application displays real-time data collected by the robot’s sensors,
                    including temperature, humidity, gas presence, fire detection, and light intensity. All sensor
                    readings are updated live on the application interface, enabling continuous monitoring of the
                    surrounding environment
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application also analyzes the received data by comparing it with predefined safety thresholds.
                    Based on this comparison, the app evaluates the danger level of the area and provides clear
                    indications to help the user understand environmental risks instantly. This feature supports quick
                    and informed decision-making during exploration missions
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using MIT App Inventor made it possible to develop a reliable, flexible, and easily customizable
                    application, allowing future enhancements such as data logging, alerts, and interface improvements
                    without complex coding. The application plays a critical role in enhancing overall system safety and
                    usability, making the robot more effective in hazardous environment exploration
