            <h2>Application Description</h2>
            <section class="project-details">
                <p>
                    To ensure safe and efficient interaction with the robot, a dedicated Android application was
                    developed using MIT App Inventor. The application acts as the main interface between the user and
                    the robot, providing control, monitoring, and data visualization in a simple and user-friendly
                    manner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through the application, the user can remotely control the robot’s movement smoothly in all
                    directions via Bluetooth communication. This allows the robot to navigate streets and potentially
                    hazardous or hard-to-reach areas without exposing humans to direct danger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to movement control, the application displays real-time data collected by the robot’s
                    sensors, including temperature, humidity, gas presence, and sound intensity. All sensor readings are
                    updated live on the application interface, enabling continuous monitoring of environmental
                    conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The robot is equipped with a GPS module, and the application displays the robot’s current location
                    on an interactive map. This feature allows users to track the robot’s movement in real time,
                    identify monitored street locations, and link environmental readings to their exact geographical
                    positions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The application also stores sensor readings for future reference. Users can access previously
                    recorded data at any time through the application, enabling comparison of environmental conditions
                    over different periods and supporting long-term analysis of pollution levels in various areas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using MIT App Inventor makes the application reliable, flexible, and easy to customize. This allows
                    for future enhancements such as advanced data analysis, alerts, and interface improvements,
                    improving overall system safety and usability.
                </p>
